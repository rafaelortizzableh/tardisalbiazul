- 👋 Hi, I’m @tardisalbiazul
- 👀 I’m interested in web development and mobile development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, NodeJS and React. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects on any of the technologies, as most of the work I've done has been done for private entities. 
- 📫 You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelortizzableh/ "Rafael Ortiz Zableh - Linkedin")

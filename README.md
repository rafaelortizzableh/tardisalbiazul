## 👋 Hi, I'm Rafa

### A little bit about me:
- 💙 I'm creating awesome stuff with Flutter and do most of my coding in Dart, but I'm familar with Javascript and I'm (slowly but steadily) learning GO.
- 🔴 I'm part of [Red Mars](https://redmars.es), a small digital consultancy.

Today I'm based in Barcelona and I'm a Software Developer.
<br>
Yesterday I lived in Bogotá and was a marketeer. And a tv/radio journalist before that.
<br>
At some point in the past I've been a student in Saint Paul, MN and Bucaramanga, Colombia.
<br>

Tomorrow? Doing something great, hopefully. One life -> Many lives.
